                                cultures, and it influences how we see and interact with other cultures. We help people

                            <p> History Book was founded in 2023 by IT-GLOBE-Trainee's(Students at GIET). We realized that
                                the
                                internet was missing a reliable and comprehensive resource for ancient history, which is why
                                the website was called History Book. What was available online was either scattered across
                                various
                                websites, illegible due to poor presentations or tainted with a distinct nationalist
                                agenda.<br>
                                We also had the idea that history was not linear (as it is taught in most school
                                coursebooks), but rather a very parallel type of story, where everything is interlinked.
                                After much programming on a netbook , the site was designed to the public in May 2023.
