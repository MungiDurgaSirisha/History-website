                    <p>After Rāma and Sītā have been married, an elderly Daśaratha expresses his desire to crown Rāma,
                        to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support. On the eve of the great
                        event, Kaikeyī was happy about this, but was later on provoked by Mantharā, a wicked
                        maidservant, to claim two boons that Daśaratha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyī demands Rāma to
                        be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son
                        Bharata.</p>

                    <p>The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyī's
                        demands. Rāma accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm
                        self-control which characterizes him throughout the story. He asks Sītā to remain in Ayodhyā,
                        but she convinces him to remain with him in exile. Lakṣmaṇa also resolves to follow his brother
                        into the forest.</p>

                    <p>After Rāma's departure, King Daśaratha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile,
                        Bharata, who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhyā. Bharata
                        refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rāma in the forest. He requests
                        Rāma to return and rule. But Rāma, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter,
                        refuses to return before the period of exile.</p>
