            <h2>HISTORY OF BANJARA CRAFTS</h2>

            <p>The colourful threads used on the basic cloth along with tiny mirrors, beads and cowrie shells impart a vibrant look to the piece of cloth. The mirrors, beads and shells diverse style of stitching - herringbone, simple chain stitching, long and short stitch.

                Generally diverse colours such as pink, white, yellow and blue coloured clothes are used. In many instances, blue or brown cloth is used to ensure proper amount of contrast to enhance the beauty of the embroidery.
                
                Banjara needle craft presents a range of embroidery such as bags, kurtas, cushions, gift articles, women garment fabric, bed sheets, and other home furnishing cloths.</p>
    
            <p>Banjara needle work is not exotic by itself, but is the cut, craft and the ideas picked from nature that make it so different. Before itsy-bitsy blouses showing décolletage or open back blouses became fashion statements in urban areas, Banjara women were stitching and wearing them. It was this nifty needle work that incorporated mirrors and shells that drew the attention of the Crafts Council officials to Sepavat Angoori, then a 17-year-old married girl with a daughter, in Yellamma tanda (hamlet), Ibrahimpatnam taluk.

            <h2>HOW IT'S DONE</h2>
    
            <p>Back in history, they were known to use a fabric of poor quality subject to availability, which has changed to materials sourced from mills.

 

                They illustrate designs on the fabric and engage in intricate embroidery with various stitches. They use a combination of stitches, like the simple chain stitch, double herringbone stitch, long and short stitch, or a type of a backstitch, to form patterns.
                
                
                After the base embroidery, they embellish the design using beads, shells, ghungroos, and mirrors. The mirror work and ghungroos add to its uniqueness, the distinguishing factor from other tribal embroideries.

                </div>
        
        
                <p>From such odd ways of living, a unique sense of aesthetics has emerged in them, which along with the influences of their forefathers, has caused these tribesmen to develop their own simple methods of craft. One such form is the needle craft.

                    The traditional costume of the Banjara women consists of a kanchali—a backless blouse, phetia or ghagra—a  full gathered skirt, and a head mantle—the chhatiya dominated by the colour palette of bright yellow, orange, black and red that identifies them immediately. Heavily embroidered, the stitch usage and  placement is specific enough to associate the wearer with their respective tandas—the historic Banjara camps. The bold, colourful, asymmetric embroidery is further embellished with coins, beads, cowrie shells, along with pom-poms, trims and applique work. The ubiquitous use of mirrors, large and small, is considered to be auspicious as it deflects the evil eye</p>
        
                <p>Besides their dress, the women embroider personal and home accessories for the family from storage bags, pot rings, belts, envelope pouches, coin purses to ceremonial cloth and seat covers, to animal trappings and accessories.

                    Previously embroidered only for personal use, over the past few decades several organisations have worked closely with  Banjara women to revive traditional stitches, patterns and designs  while providing them with income from their commercially generated work. A range of Banjara embroidered products now being made available for wider consumption.</p>
