                <h2>Veeranatyam</h2>
                <p>Veeranatyam, which means the "Dance of the Brave", is a traditional form of dance, which belongs to Andhra
                    Pradesh, a state located at the south eastern coastal areas of India. This dance form is associated with
                    religious significance. Like any other dance form of this state of the country, Veeranatyam even includes a
                    variety of colorful costumes as well as different kinds of musical instruments. The main characteristic
                    features of this dance pattern are the dex-ter-ous move-ments of hands and other skill-ful steps.</p>
        
                <h2> History behind Veeranatyam</h2>
                <div class="img_deg">
                    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/aa/ac/2eaaac47272865d349243067aef7815a.png" alt="">
                </div>
        
        
                <p>The name of this form of dance is found in the mythology of the Hindu religion. As per that mythological
                    belief, God Shiva got furious after Sati Devi, His wife was humiliated. Outraged at that humiliation, God
                    Shiva picked out "Jatajuta", a relic from His hair that created Veerabhadra. The extreme anger of Him was
                    portrayed by the performance of a vigorous dance, which is believed to be the cause of destruction of the
                    "Dakshayagna Vatika", which was the location of the function, where the wife of God Shiva was humiliated. To
                    justify the reason, it was named as "Veeranatyam". However, it is called the "Dance of Destruction or
                    Pralayam" as well.</p>
        
                <p>In this Indian state, initially, this dance form originated as one of the rituals that were performed in the
                    honor of God Shiva in the different Shiva temples located there. Veerabhadra's followers, in particular the
                    community of Veeramusti or Veerabhadriya residing in the state, are famous for performing Veeranatyam.
                    Veerabhadriyas or Veeramustis claim themselves to be the Veerabhadra's descendant. Thus, this dancing style
                    is even called Veerabhadra Natyam, which is performed by people from Draksharama, which is located at the
                    eastern bank of the Godavari River. Apart from that, the other areas known for performing this style of
                    dance are the western side of the river Godavari, Kurnool, Anantapur, Khammam and Warangal.</p>
        
                <h2> Stages of Veeranatyam</h2>
        
                <p>This dance pattern, mainly performed by male dancers, has got 3 distinctive stages that are mentioned below:
                </p>
        
                <p>1st Stage: The dance starts with holding a big plate, named as "Veerabhadra Pallem", which bears camphor fire
                    and is being carried to the elbows from the palms. Till the fire gets extinguished, the dance is performed
                    vigorously to the rhythm of the percussion instruments. A part of this stage is even occupied by a recital
                    called 'Khadgalu', where a priest brandishes a huge sword that represents Veerabhadra.</p>
        
                <p> 2nd Stage: This stage is featured with the holding of a long holy pole, which is marked with sacred ash or
                    Vibhuti that symbolizes the 'Dhwaja Sthamba'. Bells are tied to the top most part of those sacred poles.</p>
        
                <p>3rd Stage: In this stage, the performers dance with tridents and spears into their tongue, hands and ankles.
                    This is known as 'Narasam'. Dressed in knee length colorful dhotis along with waist sashes and smeared with
                    sacred ash, these performers end the dance. The main instrument used here is the war drum or "Veeranam". The
                    other musical instruments accompanying this one are Dolu, Soolam, Thambura and Thasha.</p>

                <p>Veeranatyam is a folk dance performed to honor Lord Shiva. It is a very devotional dance. The name is derived
                    from Veerabhadra – the form of Lord Shiva worshipped in this dance. This devotional dance for Lord Shiva
                    displays a lot of rage and fierce postures.</p>
                <p>Veeranatyam dance is from Andhra Pradesh. It is also known as Veerabhadra Natyam or Natyam. On breaking the
                    term Veeranatyam we will get Veera that means brave and Natyam that means dance. Thus Veeranatyam means
                    dance of the brave. </p>
        
                <p> This dance is mostly performed by men. They worship Shiva in his most fierce form Veerbhadra. Veerbhadra is
                    said to be one of the oldest godly incarnations on earth. </p>
        
                <h2>Story of Veerabhadra</h2>

                <p> Once Daksha, father of Goddess Sati, organized a Yagya. Everyone was invited except Lord Shiva. Wanting to
                    meet her childhood friends, Sati went to this event without her husband.</p>
        
                <p>She was not treated very well at her father’s place. Soon an argument broke out between Daksha and Sati. When
                    she couldn’t take the insult of her husband anymore, she self-immolated herself. Veeranatyam is based on
                    this story of Sati sacrificing herself using the Agni within called Yogagani.</p>
        
                <p>Shiva loved Sati dearly. He was heartbroken and devastated by her death. He cut a lock of his hair from which
                    two incarnations appeared – Veerbhadra and Bhadrakali. These two brought fierce power to the world which was
                    too powerful to bear. The destruction and sadness that followed after these incarnations were tremendous.
