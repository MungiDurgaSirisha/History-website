Yes, according to this story, it is believed that birds from several geographical locations come here not to mate, migrate or do something else but to commit suicide. due to which the birds tend to lose their homes and have to migrate to some other place. According to the locals, the birds look somewhat dazed, disoriented and end up crashing into trees, lights and buildings.
