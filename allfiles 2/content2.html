        <p>It is important to know this tale before we try to understand Veeranatyam, as the true emotions can only be
            known after knowing how Shiva must have felt when Sati died. It is these emotions that dancers try to bring
            on stage when they perform Veeranatyam. </p>
        <h2>Veeranatyam Dance Performance</h2>
        <p>The dance starts with dancers appearing on stage with a plate called “Veerabhadra Pallem” carried camphor
            fire. This plate is so big that it is carried out on hands from elbow to palm. Then the dancers dance till
            the fire extinguishes. A priest holding chants in the background while the dance performance is going on.
            The dancers stay in colorful clothes that represent rage, anger, and passion. The colors also represent fire
            as it is the most fearful aliment in the world. </p>

        <p>The performance is very hard and tiresome. If dancers do not have enough experience they might hurt
            themselves. It takes one or two years’ continuous practice to perform this dance. Nowadays, it gets
            performed in temples or while taking oaths. </p>
