                              <h2>PERINI SIVATHANDAVAM</h2>
                              <p>Perini Sivathandavam (Perini Śivathandavam) or Perini Thandavam is an ancient dance form from Telangana which has been revived in recent time.[1] It prospered during the Kakatiya dynasty.[2] Perini is performed in honour of Lord Shiva, the Hindu God and it is believed that in ancient times this was performed before the soldiers set to war. Nataraja Ramakrishna revived the art form by studying old manuscripts and sculptures at Ramappa Temple.

                            <p>The Perini Siva Thandavam is a dance form usually performed by males. It is called 'Dance of Warriors'. Warriors before leaving to the battlefield enact this dance before the idol of Lord Śiva.[4] The dance form, Perini, reached its pinnacle during the rule of the Kakatiyas who established their dynasty at Warangal and ruled for almost two centuries. The dance form is mentioned in the Sanskrit text Nrttya Ratnavali of Jayapa Senani.[4] Based on its complex parts and myths, it is believed that the dance form developed for a long time prior to it.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that this dance form invokes 'Prerana' (inspiration) and is dedicated to supreme dancer, Lord Shiva. One can find evidence of this dance in the sculptures near Garbha Gudi (Sanctum Sanctorum) of the Ramappa Temple at Warangal.[6][4]

                                Perini is a vigorous dance done to the resounding beats of drums. Dancers drive themselves to a state of mental abstraction where they feel the power of Shiva in their body. While dancing they invoke Shiva to come into him and dance through him. The dance was also performed on special platforms in front of temples.[5] Perini dance form almost disappeared after the decline of the Kakatiya dynasty but Dr. Nataraja Ramakrishna brought renaissance in Perini dance.

                            <h2>HOW PERINI SIVATHANDAVAM IS PERFORMED?</h2>
                    
                            <p>Usually, the PerSini Natyam is performed by males. Hindus believe that the dance form invokes Lord Shiva in the male. According to Hinduism, every male is Lord Shiva and every female is Shakti. While the male performs Perini Natyam, the destructive form of Lord Shiva gets invoked in them. For this reason, they perform this dance before going to war. The destructive power gained from the lord helps to destroy the evil (the enemy) and win the battle.

                                <p>Perini Shivatandavam is the ‘dance of the warriors’ performed by the males. The warriors performed this vigorous dance in front of the idol of Lord Shiva, dedicating to the Supreme dancer before going to the battlefield. It was believed that Perini Shivatandavam raises ‘prerana’ or inspiration among the soldiers. Evidence of this dance form can be viewed on the walls and pillars of the Ramappa Temple in Warangal where sculptures of various postures of Perini Shivatandavam dance are still intact.

                                <p>The enchanting forgotten dance form was resurrected from extinction and was showcased in the first Telegu Mahasabha by three disciples of Dr. Nataraja Ramakrishna in 1975. Perini Shivatandavam is enacted on the loud roaring beats of the drums, matching the postures with its rhythm. Dancers perform while feeling the power of their muse, Lord Shiva inside their body. A training programme has been set up by SRR Government Art and Science College in Karimnagar for the interested students in order to preserve this ancient dance form. Students get training on Perini Shivatandavam along with Perini Lasyam, a derivative of the same for the girls.
