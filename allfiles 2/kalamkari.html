                <h2>Kalamkari</h2>
                <p>Kalamkari is a type of hand-painted cotton textile produced in the Deccan region of India, in the
                    regions formerly part of the Golconda Sultanate, including the states of Telangana and Andhra
                    Pradesh. Only natural dyes are used in Kalamkari, which involves twenty-three steps.<br>There are
                    two distinctive styles of Kalamkari art in India – Srikalahasti style and the Machilipatnam style.
                    The Srikalahasti style of Kalamkari, where the "kalam" or pen is used for freehand drawing of the
                    subject and filling in the colors, is entirely hand worked. This style flourished in temples
                    centered on creating unique religious identities, appearing on scrolls, temple hangings, chariot
                    banners as well as depictions of deities and scenes taken from the Hindu epics (e.g. Ramayana,
                    Mahabharata and Purana). The style owes its present status to Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay who
                    popularized the art as the first chairperson of the All India Handicrafts Board.</p>
                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>Historically, Kalamkari used to be termed as Pattachitra, an art form still found in neighboring
                    Odisha and other parts of India and Nepal.[5][6] The term "Pattachitra" (Sanskrit: पट्टचित्र)
                    translates to "patta", meaning "cloth", with "chitra" meaning "picture".[7][6] Paintings made on
                    fabric and fabric scrolls are mentioned in ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Jain literature.</p>
                <p>When Southern India was under medieval Islamic rule, the term Kalamkari was derived from the Persian
                    words kalam, which means "pen", and kari, which means "craftsmanship". This term became popular
                    under the patronage of the Golconda sultanate.</p>
                <h2> History behind Kalamkari</h2>

                <p>Musicians and painters, known as chitrakars, moved from village to tell the village dwellers the
                    stories of Hindu mythology. They illustrated their accounts using large bolts of canvas painted on
                    the spot with simple means and dyes extracted from plants. Similarly, the ones found in Hindu
                    temples are large panels of Kalamkari depicting the episodes of Hindu mythology and iconography,
                    similar to Buddhist Thangka paintings.</p>

                </div>
                <p>As an art form, it was found in the wealthy peak of Golconda sultanate, Hyderabad, in the Middle
                    Ages. The Mughals who patronized this craft in the Coromandel and Golconda province called the
                    practitioners of this craft "Qualamkars", from which the term "Kalamkari" evolved.The Pedana
                    Kalamkari craft made in Pedana nearby Machilipatnam in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, evolved
                    under the patronage of the Mughals and the Golconda sultanate. Owing to the said patronage, this
                    school was influenced by Persian art under Islamic rule.</p>

                <p>Kalamkari art has been practiced by many families in Andhra Pradesh, some villages in Tamil Nadu
                    (Sikkalnayakanpettai) by migrants from Telugu speaking families over the generations have
                    constituted their livelihood. Kalamkari had a period of decline, then was revived in India and
                    abroad for its craftsmanship. Since the 18th century, the British have enjoyed the decorative
                    element for clothing.
                </p>

                <p>Kalamkari is an ancient style of hand painting done on cotton or silk fabric with a tamarind pen,
                    using natural dyes. The word Kalamkari is derived from a Persian word where ‘kalam‘ means pen and
                    ‘kari‘ refers to craftsmanship. This art involves 23 tedious steps of dyeing, bleaching, hand
                    painting, block printing, starching, cleaning and more. Motifs drawn in Kalamkari spans from
                    flowers, peacock, paisleys to divine characters of Hindu epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana.
                    Nowadays, this art is primarily done to create Kalamkari sarees.</p>

                <p>Centuries ago, folk singers and painters used to wander from one village to other, narrating stories
                    of Hindu mythology to the village people. But with course of time, the process of telling tales
                    transformed into canvas painting and that’s when Kalamkari art first saw the light of day. This
                    colorful art dates back to more than 3000 B.C. According to the historians, fabric samples depicting
                    Kalamkari art was found at the archeological sites of Mohenjo-daro.</p>

                <div class="img_right">
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Kalamkari.jpg/330px-Kalamkari.jpg"
                        alt="">
                </div>

                <p>But, it was during the Mughal era when this style of painting got recognition. Mughals promoted this
                    art in the Golconda and Coromandel province where skillful craftsmen (known as Qualamkars) used to
                    practice this art, that’s how this art and the word Kalamkari evolved. Under the Golconda sultanate,
                    this art flourished at Machilipatnam in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh and further was
                    promoted during the 18th century, as a decorative design on clothing by Britishers in India.

                </p>
                <p>Till today, many families in Andhra Pradesh continue to practice this art and this has served as the
                    prime source of livelihood for them, over the generations.</p>
                <h2>The Making</h2>
                <div class="img_right">
                    <img src="https://www.utsavpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Process-flow-of-making-Kalamkari1.png"
                        alt="">
                </div>
                <p>The process of making Kalamkari involves 23 steps. From natural process of bleaching the fabric,
                    softening it, sun drying, preparing natural dyes, hand painting, to the processes of air drying and
                    washing, the entire procedure is a process which requires precision and an eye for
                    detailing.<br>Cotton fabric used for Kalamkari is first treated with a solution of cow dung and
                    bleach. After keeping the fabric in this solution for hours, the fabric gets a uniform off-white
                    color. After this, the cotton fabric is immersed in a mixture of buffalo milk and Myrobalans. This
                    avoids smudging of dyes in the fabric when it is painted with natural dyes. Later, the fabric is
                    washed under running water to get rid of the odor of buffalo milk. The fabric likewise, is washed
                    twenty times and dried under the sun. Once the fabric is ready for painting, artists sketch motifs
                    and designs on the fabric. Post this, the Kalamkari artists prepare dyes using natural sources to
                    fill colors within the drawings.<br>Incorporating minute details, the Kalamkars use ‘tamarind twig’
                    as pen, to sketch beautiful motifs of Krishna Raas-Leela, Indian god and goddesses like Parvati,
                    Vishnu, Shri Jaganath; designs of peacock, lotus; and scenes from the Hindu epics like Mahabharata
                    and Ramayana.</p>
                <h2>Colors of Kalamkari</h2>
                <p>Kalamkari art primarily use earthy colors like indigo, mustard, rust, black and green. Natural dyes
                    used to paint colors in Kalamkari art is extracted for natural sources with no use of chemicals and
                    artificial matter. For instance, craftsmen extract black color by blending jaggery, water and iron
                    fillings which they essentially use for outlining the sketches. While mustard or yellow is derived
                    by boiling pomegranate peels, red hues are created from bark of madder or algirin. Likewise, blue is
                    obtained from indigo and green is derived by mixing yellow and blue together.</p>
                <h2>Types of Kalamkari</h2>
                <p>There are two identifiable styles of Kalamkari art in India – Srikalahasti style and Machilipatnam
                    style. In the Machilipatnam style of Kalamkari, motifs are essentially printed with hand-carved
                    traditional blocks with intricate detailing painted by hands. On the other hand, Srikalahasti style
                    of painting draws inspiration from the Hindu mythology describing scenes from the epics and
                    folklore. This style holds a strong religious connect because of its origin in the temples.<br>In
                    recent times, two other types of Kalamkari patterns have also emerged, based on the states where it
                    is created. Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are two prime states in India, where two different types of
                    Kalamkari patterns are done. The Andhra Kalamkari borrows design inspiration from forts, palaces and
                    temples of India, along with motifs of animals and birds. While the Gujarat Kalamkari depict motifs
                    of mythological characters like Krishna-Arjuna from Mahabharata, lord Krishna, lord Ganesha, lord
                    Buddha etc.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>Present Day Scenario</h2>
                <p>From the first representation of Kalamkari art as religious paintings, depicting Indian gods and
                    goddesses to the process of gaining recognition during the reign of Mughal dynasty, and till today
                    when Andhra Pradesh is the largest producer of Kalamkari; this art has come a long way.<br>In the
                    past decade, due to the tedious technique involved in its making, Kalamkari art was losing its
                    shine. The emergence of high on technology machine looms and printed textiles also escalated the
                    extinction process of this art. But it was the fashion designers of the Indian fashion industry who
                    came together to revive this art and helped artisans practicing this art in the state of Andhra
                    Pradesh. Creative minds like Gaurang Shah beautifully portrayed Kalamkari sarees on the fashion
                    runways which brought back this immortal art back in the limelight.
